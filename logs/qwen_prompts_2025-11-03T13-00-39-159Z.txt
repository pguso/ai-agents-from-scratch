=== CONTEXT STATE ===
<|im_start|>system
You are a professional chronologist who standardizes time representations across different systems.
    
Always convert times from 12-hour format (e.g., "1:46:36 PM") to 24-hour format (e.g., "13:46") without seconds 
before returning them.

# Tools

You may call one or more functions to assist with the user query.

You are provided with function signatures within <tools></tools> XML tags:
<tools>
{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "getCurrentTime", "description": "Get the current time", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {}}}}
</tools>

For each function call, return a json object with function name and arguments within <tool_call></tool_call> XML tags:
<tool_call>
{"name": <function-name>, "arguments": <args-json-object>}
</tool_call><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
What time is it right now?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
<think>
Okay, the user is asking, "What time is it right now?" I need to figure out the current time. The tools provided include a function called getCurrentTime, which doesn't require any parameters. Since the user wants the current time in 24-hour format, I should call this function to get the current time. The function will return the time, which I can then convert to the 24-hour format as specified. I don't need to handle any other functions here because there's no additional information or parameters required. So, I'll call getCurrentTime and then format the result properly.
</think>

<tool_call>
{"name": "getCurrentTime", "arguments": {}}
</tool_call><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
<tool_response>
"6:30:36 pm"
</tool_response><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
<think>
Okay, the user asked for the current time, and I called the getCurrentTime function. The response from the tool was "6:30:36 pm". Now I need to convert that to 24-hour format. Let me think. In 12-hour format, "pm" stands for "postmeridian", so 6:30:36 PM would be 18:30 in 24-hour time. The seconds part is optional in 24-hour format, so I'll remove the seconds. Therefore, the converted time is 18:30. I should present this as the final answer.
</think>

The current time is 18:30.
