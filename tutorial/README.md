# AI Agents Framework Tutorial

Welcome to the step-by-step tutorial for building your own AI agent framework!

This tutorial teaches you to build a **lightweight, educational version of LangChain.js** -
with the same core concepts and API, but simpler implementations designed for learning.

Instead of diving into LangChain's complex codebase, you'll rebuild its key patterns
yourself with clear, educational code. By the end, you'll understand what frameworks
are actually doing, making you far more effective at using them.

**What you'll implement:**
- Runnable interface (LangChain's composability pattern)
- Message types (structured conversations)
- LLM wrappers (model integration)
- Chains (composing operations)
- Agents (decision-making loops)
- Graphs (LangGraph state machines)

**What makes this different:**
- LangChain-compatible API (what you learn transfers directly)
- Simpler implementations (much less code, same concepts)
- Educational focus (understanding over completeness)
- Real, working code (not pseudocode or toys)

Build it yourself. Understand it deeply. Use LangChain confidently.
